# Truth or Dare Turing Test
### designed and developed by [FOREIGN OBJECTS](https://www.foreignobjects.net/) for Mozilla Creative Awards 2019

To start the project:

`npm run dev`

This will start the app on `localhost:3000`, and start a netlify-lambda proxy server (which handles requests to Dialogflow, and Google authentication) on `localhost:9000`. (In order for this part to work, you need to set up google OAuth in your local environment -- without this, nothing gets sent to dialogflow)
